    <h5>Personas</h5>
    <p>1. Marcy is in her late 20s and lives in the city. There is limited parking in the city, so she often rides her bike to work. She usually only uses a bike chain to lock up her bike,</p>
    <p>but is looking for something a little more secure. She is a middle class citizen who has access to the internet and wants to keep her bike protected against theifs while she is in the office.</p>
    <p>2. John is an older man who lives in the suburbs, but likes to ride his bike into his downtown for a coffee or to his favorite breakfast place. Since he's not gone for a long time, he usually just</p>
    <p>leaves his bike in the bike holder with no security. Lately he's been worried that someone might steal his bike, so he wants to find more information on bike locks online that could give</p>
    <p>him a peace of mind. He is a middle class citizen who has access to the internet </p>
    <p>3. Kim is a middle age mom who enjoys cycling to stay healthy. She often rides for long periods at a time, but likes to occasionally stop to fill up her water bottle. Her bike is pretty expensive, </p>
    <p>and she is worried someone might steal it while she's gone. She wants to find a lock that is not too heavy, but that will keep her bike secure, so she goes online to search for a bike lock.</p>
    <p>She is a middle class person who has access to the internet.</p>
